    "other_animals_affected": [
        "Cattle, other large ruminants such as goats and sheep (though presentation may differ)"

    "cause": [
        "Difficult calving (dystocia) leading to trauma, uterine prolapse, retained placenta, metritis; other causes requiring veterinary examination to rule out"
    ],
    "symptoms": [
        "Lying down and unable to stand, swollen vulva (possibly prolapsed uterus), visible injury or trauma, signs of pain or distress,  lack of appetite, fever (potentially)"
    ],
    "transmission": [
        "Not infectious, but difficult birth can be influenced by factors such as genetics, birth weight, and pelvic conformation."
    ],
    "remedy": [
        "Immediate veterinary attention is crucial. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, and may include: assistance with calving (if ongoing), treatment of uterine prolapse (replacement and support), antibiotics for infection (metritis), pain relief, fluids and electrolytes, potential surgical intervention."
    ],
    "preventive_measures": [
        "Careful breeding practices (consider genetic selection for easier calving), regular pre-calving veterinary check-ups (pelvic measurements, fetal monitoring), proper nutrition and body condition scoring before and during pregnancy, provision of clean and comfortable birthing areas."
    ],
    "environmental_conditions": [
        "Clean, dry, comfortable calving areas, adequate space, reduced stress factors."

        "Calciphylaxis (calcium deficiency) can contribute to difficulty standing, though this requires further examination. Balanced nutrition is crucial, particularly calcium and phosphorus supplementation during late pregnancy."

    "biosecurity_measures": [
        "Clean and disinfect calving area after each birth, appropriate hygiene for handlers to prevent infection."
    ],
    "post_infection_management": [
        "Monitor for signs of infection or complications, provide supportive care (including nutrition and pain relief), regular veterinary check-ups until full recovery."
